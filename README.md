## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- My main focus while doing this challenge was to recap my designing ui and make pixel perfect as close as possible and making it responsive as given in the design.

- And I wanted to do some small animation kind of thing when submitted so I built using pure CSS.

### Continued development

- I think, more can be done here like making animation and functionality for dimissal popup too.



### Useful resources

- [Setting custom bullet](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/css-list-style-image-vertical-alignment-issue/5242) - This helped me for setting that "correct / tick / âœ…" icon. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
